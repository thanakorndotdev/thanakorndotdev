I've built this project as a part of my learning and passion for full-stack development.

It demonstrates how to combine modern web technologies, clean architecture, and responsive design principles into a practical, production-ready solution.

This repository showcases:

\- Scalable \*\*frontend development\*\* using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

\- Efficient \*\*backend integration\*\* with Node.js / Express and RESTful APIs.

\- Deployment readiness with \*\*Docker\*\*, \*\*Cloudflare\*\*, and \*\*Firebase Hosting\*\*.

\- A clean and structured \*\*UI/UX layout\*\*, emphasizing accessibility and performance.

\- Reusable, maintainable code that follows modern \*\*best practices\*\*.

The goal of this project is not only to demonstrate technical capability but also to show real-world problem-solving, teamwork mindset, and software craftsmanship — reflecting my long-term journey toward becoming a professional full-stack engineer.

Feel free to explore the source code, open issues, or suggest improvements.
